The digital game Arduino Pinball is conceived as an arcade game in which players win points controlling the ball on the game board. The primary goal of the game is to score as many points as possible. Points are earned by shooting various objects on the game board. At the bottom of the board are the pinball machines he controls player. The idea of the project is to turn a classic pinball game into a fun, digital game using an Arduino MKR1000 microcontroller as a basis. The microcontroller and program code are used for management sticks, detecting the points scored by the player and printing the results and game interface on the LCD screen. Game uses several sensors that detect key events during the game.
